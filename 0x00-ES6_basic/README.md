# ES6 Basics
ES6, short for ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard, which is the specification that JavaScript follows. It was a significant update to the language, introducing new features, syntax improvements, and additional functionalities to make JavaScript more powerful and expressive.

## Description
ES6 features collectively improve code readability, maintainability, and developer productivity, bringing JavaScript more in line with modern programming practices.

## Features
 * **Let and Const Declarations:** let allows block-scoped variable declarations, and const declares read-only constants.
 * **Arrow Functions:** A concise syntax for writing functions, with implicit return and lexically scoped this.
 * **Default Parameters:** Allows function parameters to have default values if not provided.
 * **Rest Parameters:** Enables a function to accept any number of arguments as an array.
 * **Template Literals:** String templating using backticks (`...`), allowing embedded expressions and multi-line strings.
 * **Destructuring Assignment:** Provides a concise syntax for extracting values from arrays or properties from objects.
 * **Classes:** Introduced class syntax for creating constructor functions and prototypes in a more structured way.
 * **Iterators and for-of Loop:** Enables a standardized way to iterate over collections with the Symbol.iterator and the for-of loop.
 * **Enhanced Object Literals:** Allows concise syntax for defining object properties and methods.
 * **Spread Operator:** Spreads the elements of an iterable (like an array) into a new array or object.
