## Description
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It extends JavaScript by providing optional static typing, interfaces, classes, and other features that enhance development at scale. TypeScript code is transpiled into plain JavaScript, making it compatible with existing JavaScript environments. Developers often choose TypeScript for larger codebases where the benefits of static typing, interfaces, and other features can help catch errors early, improve code maintainability, and enhance collaboration within development teams.

## Features
 * **Static Typing:** TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing developers to specify the types of variables, parameters, and return values. This helps catch potential type-related errors during development.
 * **Interfaces and Classes:** TypeScript supports the definition of interfaces and classes, which are not part of standard JavaScript. This enables developers to write more structured and object-oriented code.
 * **Enums:** Enums (enumerations) provide a way to define a set of named constants, making code more readable and maintainable.
 * **Generics:** TypeScript allows the use of generics, which provide a way to create flexible and reusable components by allowing types to be specified later.
 * **Modules:** TypeScript supports the use of modules and namespaces, enabling developers to organize their code into separate files and encapsulate functionality.
 * **Improved Tooling:** TypeScript comes with a rich set of development tools, including autocompletion, code navigation, and refactoring support in modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).
 * **Compatibility with JavaScript:** TypeScript is designed to be compatible with existing JavaScript code. Developers can gradually adopt TypeScript in their projects, and TypeScript files can coexist with JavaScript files in the same project.
 * **Type Inference:** TypeScript has a powerful type inference system that can infer types even when they are not explicitly specified. This reduces the need for extensive type annotations.
 * **Declaration Files:** TypeScript uses declaration files (files with a .d.ts extension) to provide type information for libraries or modules written in JavaScript.
 * **Community and Ecosystem:** TypeScript has gained popularity, and it has a strong community of developers. It is widely used in modern web development and is supported by popular frameworks and tools.
