# NodeJS Basics 
Is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that enables developers to execute JavaScript code outside a web browser, primarily for server-side scripting and building network applications.

## Description
Node.js promotes consistency and ease of development. Node.js is open-source, cross-platform, and has a large and active community of developers contributing to its growth and development. Overall, Node.js is a powerful and versatile platform that is well-suited for building real-time, high-performance network applications. Its event-driven architecture, asynchronous I/O capabilities, and extensibility with NPM packages make it a popular choice among developers for building scalable and efficient applications. 

## Features
* **Event-driven architecture:** Node.js uses an event-driven architecture that allows developers to write non-blocking code that can handle multiple requests simultaneously. This makes it highly scalable and efficient for building network applications.
* **Asynchronous I/O capabilities:** Node.js has built-in support for asynchronous I/O operations, which allows it to handle large amounts of data and requests without blocking the event loop. This makes it ideal for building real-time applications that require high performance and low latency.
* **Single-threaded but high-performing:** Node.js is single-threaded, but it uses a non-blocking I/O model that allows it to handle multiple requests simultaneously. This makes it highly performant and efficient, even on low-end hardware.
* **Extensibility with NPM packages:** Node.js has a vast ecosystem of third-party packages available through the Node Package Manager (NPM). These packages can be easily installed and integrated into Node.js applications, making it easy to add new functionality and features.
* **Support for popular web protocols:** Node.js has built-in support for popular web protocols like HTTP, DNS, and TCP, making it easy to build web applications and network services.
