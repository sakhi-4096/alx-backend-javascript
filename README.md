## Description
Traditionally, JavaScript was primarily used for client-side scripting, running in the browser to enhance the interactivity and functionality of web pages. However, with the introduction of technologies like Node.js, JavaScript can now also be used on the server side.

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine used by the Google Chrome browser. This enables developers to use JavaScript for both the client and server sides of a web application, creating a unified development environment.

Backend JavaScript with Node.js is used to handle server-side logic, manage databases, handle HTTP requests, and perform various server-related tasks. It allows developers to use a single programming language (JavaScript) for both the frontend and backend of a web application, which can simplify development and maintenance.

Some popular frameworks for building backend applications with JavaScript include Express.js, Koa.js, and Nest.js. These frameworks provide a structure and set of tools to make it easier to develop scalable and maintainable server-side code using JavaScript.
